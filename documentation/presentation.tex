	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Supply chain constraints} - bare SAMD21/51 processors are hard to find on Digikey/Mouser etc. but pre-made development boards from Adafruit are still available.

	\end{figure}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Plenty of processor overhead} - recording 12 channels of IMU and accelerometer data to an SD card at 100Hz requires strict timing and interrupt handling
		\item Current planned revision is to separate IMU and high-g accelerometer interfacing to its own Cortex-M0 processor.
	\end{itemize}
