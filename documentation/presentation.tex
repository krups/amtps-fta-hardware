\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Requirements}

	Based on revision (\ddrev) of the flight test requirements document.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Instrumentation and telemetry
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Shall support betwen 8 and 20 thermocouples of varying type
			\item Shall support up to 6 absolute pressure sensors
			\item Shall support at least 1 intertial measurement unit (IMU)
			\item Should support 1 heat flux sensor
			\item Shall contain a GPS for recovery operations, accurate to with 100m
			\item Capsule shall contain an internal barometric pressure sensor 
			\item Telemetry data shall be collected at a minumum of 10Hz
			\item Telemetry data shall be stored to onboard nonvolatile memory that will survive landing
			\item Location telemetry shall be transmitted through a vehicle-to-ground system (e.g. Iridium satellite, Xbee)
			\item Recovery location should be broadcasted at least once every 5 minutes post-flight
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Activation and flight sequencing
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Shall be powered through the duration of the flight
			\item Shall support continuous operation between -20 deg C and 80 deg C
			\item Shall support pre-launch activation on the ground; should support low power mode prior to deployment
			\item Shall detect and/or sense when deployment has occurred via interfacing with the launch vehicle
			\item Shall transmit in-flight telemetry with position information
			\item In-flight telemetry should contain capsule velocity 
			\item Shall trigger parachute deployment at a specified time
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Physical properties
		\item Avionics hardware shall weigh under or around 0.5kg
		\item Shall cost under \$3,000
